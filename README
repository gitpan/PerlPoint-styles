This package shall collect various PerlPoint style examples.

It starts with a style derived from the CD style of the
German Perl Workshop CDs, which are produced with PerlPointCD,
and a style emulating a well known and often used C<pp2html>
style with Java tree navigation and frames.

Please note that the styles are incomplete yet in terms of
documentation, screenshots and the like. This shall be improved
in future versions. Nevertheless I think they already give
a good impression about the idea and structure of the new style
concept introduced with PerlPoint::Package 0.40, and they are
fully functional and usable.


INSTALLATION

Unpack the archive into a PerlPoint style base directory.
If you don't have one, make it and set the -styledir
option of your converter appropriately. See converter
docs or the tutorial in C<PerlPoint::Package> for details
about styles.


DOCUMENTATION

See converter docs about supported styles.

See C<PerlPoint::Package> and its tutorial for styles in general.



SUPPPORT

A PerlPoint mailing list is set up to discuss usage, ideas,
bugs, suggestions and translator development. To subscribe,
please send an empty message to perlpoint-subscribe@perl.org.

If you prefer, you can contact me via perl@jochen-stenzel.de
as well.


CREDITS

Thanks to Jürgen Christoffel who provided most of the CSS based
stuff (originally designed for the German Perl Workshop CDs).
