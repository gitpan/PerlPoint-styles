This is an example PerlPoint style, part of PerlPoint::Package.
It demonstrates an CSS layout.

The layout shown is derived from a real world layout, basically
designed by Jürgen Christoffel for the CDs of the German Perl
Workshop and used with permission.

This style can be used under the same terms as PerlPoint::Package
itself. Derived layouts should document their heritage.
