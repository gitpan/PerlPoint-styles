This is an example PerlPoint style, intended to be used with a PerlPoint Generator.

See the doc directory for details about the style.

This example shows the basic style subdirectories:

* cfg - for option files,

* templates - for template files,

* doc - for documentation (usually overview.pp and description.pp),

* lib - for own generator, formatter or template modules,

* images - for screenshots and the like.

This style is part of the PerlPoint::styles distribution and
can be used under the license terms to be read in the README
file attached.

The CSS parts of the templates are derived from style sheets
designed by Jürgen Christoffel. Used with permission.
