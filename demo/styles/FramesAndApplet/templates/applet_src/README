The files in this directory build the free version 1 of the Java "TreeApplet".
This software was available on the net a few years ago, was followed by
a comercial version 2, and finally disappeared.

USE THIS SOFTWARE ON YOUR OWN RISK. THIS SOFTWARE IS NO PART OF PerlPoint::Package
AND HAS ITS OWN LICENSE: AS FAR AS I KNOW, THIS VERSION WAS FREE. IF YOU ARE
IN DOUBT, PLEASE USE ANOTHER NAVIGATION APPLET OR JAVASCRIPT.
